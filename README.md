### 2. Start


Requirements:
             
	Python 2.7
	
	tensorflow-1.4.1

	scikit-image

1\) Split training set and testing set. 

Three data sets are used: Houston_2013，Pavia University and Salinas, which can be downloaded from Google Drive https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BkwgTRh3JtKqQcLQ7DkMv98jChs15JmB/view?usp=sharing.

Run "HSI_Data_Preparation_Houston.py", "HSI_Data_Preparation_PU.py" and "HSI_Data_Preparation_Salinas.py " to get training set and testing set of each data set.


2\) Run "python RIAN.py" for training and testing.

Revise lines 27-33 to change data set. Testing results are saved in the directory "result_RIAN".


3\) Run "result_RIAN/DATASETNAME/acc_in_testing_set.m" in Matlab to calculate evaluation metrics such as OA, AA and kappa. 

"DATASETNAME" is the name of data set.
